### PHP Twig tmBundle

A [TextMate][1] _(and [Sublime Text][2])_ bundle for [Twig][3], based off of the [Python Django Templates bundle][4] found on the [TextMate SVN][5].

_This bundle in it's current state is pretty bare. I hope to expand it in the future but for the time being this is what I have._


#### Notes

This is my first tmbundle and it was made and tested in [Sublime Text][2]. Everything should work fine, but if something doesn't please report it and I'll do my best to get it fixed.

I'm also not very familiar with TextMate's method of creating language syntaxes. I'm sure some of the syntax code is pretty horrid. If anyone has any input on optimizing it or on anything else, such as choices in grammar scopes, please feel free to let me know.


#### Extras

I included a few additional things in `/Extras`. There is a screenshot _(same one as displayed below)_ of the bundle in it's current state, as well as the 2 themes I'm maintaining that were updated to better accompany this bundle.
